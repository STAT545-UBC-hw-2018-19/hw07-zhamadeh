Lets start by loading our package and loading the gapminder dataset as a sample dataset. 

```{r}
library(powers)
library(gapminder)
```

This package offers two unique functions to transform your data. The `log_trans()` method performs a logarithmic transformation on your vector like so:

```{r}
log_trans(9,3)
```

Additionally, there is the `boxcox()` method for transforming your non-normal data into a more normal distribution. It takes in a numerical vector, finds the most optimal lambda to perform a box-cox transformation and then uses that lambda value to do so.

```{r}
boxcox(gapminder$lifeExp)
```
